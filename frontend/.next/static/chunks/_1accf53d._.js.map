Initial biometrics painted a picture of a system under load, with a baseline blood pressure of 136/88 mmHg and visible dips in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) tied to acute work stressors. The Elyx team initiated a foundational protocol targeting systemic inflammation and stress resilience through nutrition, mobility, and targeted supplementation. From the outset, the member revealed a key trait: a deep-seated need for evidence. He consistently requested the \"why\" behind the plan, demanding clinical data and the direct physiological mechanisms linking interventions to outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis foundational period was immediately put to the test with a high-stakes business trip to London in Week 4. The trip served as a powerful real-world stress test, and the data captured its impact with stark clarity. Recovery metrics plummeted by 25–30%, average blood pressure rose, and a powerful correlation emerged: as HRV dropped by 27.6% through the week, subjective fatigue scores soared by 167%. While the member felt the trip was a physiological \"write-off,\" it provided the most critical insight of the month: a quantifiable measure of the true cost of travel. This data transformed the conversation from subjective feelings to objective facts, paving the way for a new, targeted strategy to manage anticipatory stress and accelerate post-travel recovery.`,\r\n    primaryGoalFull:\r\n      \"Primary Goal — Establish a comprehensive physiological baseline, build foundational habits in nutrition and mobility, and begin buffering the effects of a high-stress professional life.

Instead of trying to move the unmovable, the new mission became to aggressively optimize every other modifiable risk factor. The data provided a clear playbook: better sleep was directly crushing inflammation (hs-CRP), and consistent cardio was boosting resilience (HRV).

This new resilience was put to the ultimate test during a high-stakes business trip to Singapore, where Rohan's body remained remarkably stable, performing near his at-home baseline despite the stress of international travel.
