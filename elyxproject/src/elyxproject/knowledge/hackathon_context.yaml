elyx_philosophy:
  mission: "To maximize the number of healthy years in our members' lives through a collaborative, proactive, and deeply personalized approach."
  model: "We partner with healthy members, not treat sick patients. The goal is prevention, optimization, and achieving personal goals. Every recommendation is part of a cohesive, long-term health investment."
  collaboration_ethos: "Our specialists work as an integrated team. Insights from one domain (e.g., nutrition) must inform actions in another (e.g., exercise). The member is an active participant in the process."

member_persona:
  name: Rohan Patel
  demographics: "46-year-old male, Regional Head of Sales (FinTech), based in Singapore."
  lifestyle_profile: "A high-stress, time-constrained executive. His role involves frequent and demanding international travel to key financial hubs (UK, US, Jakarta, South Korea), leading to irregular schedules, jet lag, and significant lifestyle disruption."
  primary_health_condition: "Proactively managing diagnosed Hypertension."
  family_history: "Significant family history of heart disease, which is a primary driver of his engagement with Elyx."
  health_goals:
    - "Primary Clinical Goal: Tangibly reduce his long-term risk of cardiovascular disease and enhance cognitive function to maintain his edge in a demanding career."
    - "Secondary Goals: Focus on proactive health management, early disease detection, and building resilience to the physiological stress of his job and travel."
  personal_growth_goals: "Views health as a holistic 'investment' beyond just clinical metrics. He is actively pursuing new, mentally engaging skills like learning the piano for stress management and has expressed interest in optimizing his physical performance for hobbies like golf."
  core_mindset: "An analytical 'quantified-self' enthusiast. He is not a passive patient but an active, data-driven member who sees his health as a system to be optimized."
  communication_style:
    - "Data-Driven Skepticism: He is inherently skeptical of recommendations that are not backed by hard data. He will consistently demand the 'evidence-based rationale' for any suggestion and often asks for the raw data to 'independently verify' conclusions."
    - "Efficiency-Oriented: Prefers concise, executive summaries and clear, actionable takeaways due to his time constraints. He uses a Personal Assistant (Sarah Tan) to manage all scheduling logistics."
    - "Proactive & Curious: He doesn't wait to be told what to do. He actively monitors his own data from wearables (Whoop, Garmin) and will initiate conversations with specialists based on trends he observes or questions that arise."
  key_motivators:
    - "Return on Investment (ROI): He frames his engagement in terms of ROI, wanting to see a quantifiable impact of his efforts (e.g., dietary changes on his blood pressure, workout adherence on his HRV)."
    - "Control & Understanding: He is motivated by a desire to understand the 'why' behind his body's responses and to gain a sense of control over his long-term health trajectory."
  wearables_in_use:
    - "Garmin watch (used for runs), considering Oura ring."
    - "Health apps / platforms (Trainerize, MyFitnessPal, Whoop)"
  friction_and_adherence_profile:
    - "Prone to non-adherence (~50% of the time), not out of defiance, but as a direct result of his demanding and unpredictable schedule (e.g., missed workouts due to late meetings, inconsistent diet during travel). This is a primary 'friction point' the Elyx team must proactively manage."
