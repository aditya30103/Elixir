elyx_philosophy:
  mission: "To maximize the number of healthy years in our members' lives through a collaborative, proactive, and deeply personalized approach."
  model: "We partner with healthy members, not treat sick patients. The goal is prevention, optimization, and achieving personal goals. Every recommendation is part of a cohesive, long-term health investment."
  collaboration_ethos: "Our specialists work as an integrated team. Insights from one domain (e.g., nutrition) must inform actions in another (e.g., exercise). The member is an active participant in the process."
